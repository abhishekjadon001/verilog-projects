  **OVERVIEW**
  
Welcome to the Verilog repository!

My journey to enhance verilog programming skills using xilinx vivado tool. This pratice is to strngthen my foundation in digital design and verilog HDL by solving variety of verilog problems on a daily basis. 

**HIGHLIGHTS**

**Tools used** :- Xilinx Vivado Tools.

**Focus Area** :- Basic Verilog programming, Combinational and sequential ciruits, testbench creation, simulation and synthesis.

**GOALS** :- 

1.Develop a strong foundation in Verilog HDL.

            2. Gain proficiency in using xilinx Vivado for Design and simulation.
            
            3. Build a habit of daily coding and problem-solving.

**REPOSITORY STRUCTURE** :-
This repository is organized into folders for each containing the problem statements, Verilog code, and testbenches. Each folder includes:


. **Verilog Code**: The Verilog implementation of the solution.


. **Testbench**: The testbench used the validate the solution.


.**Simulation Results**: Screenshots of the simulation results (where applicable).


. **Schematic Result**: Schematic view of the Design.
