  **OVERVIEW**
  
Welcome to the Verilog repository!

My journey to enhance verilog programming skills using xilinx vivado tool. This pratice is to strngthen my foundation in digital design and verilog HDL by solving variety of verilog problems on a daily basis. 

**HIGHLIGHTS**

**Tools used** :- Xilinx Vivado Tools.

**Focus Area** :- Basic Verilog programming, Combinational and sequential ciruits, testbench creation, simulation and synthesis.

**GOALS** :- 1.Develop a strong foundation in Verilog HDL.

            2. Gain proficiency in using xilinx Vivado for Design and simulation.
            
            3. Build a habit of daily coding and problem-solving.
